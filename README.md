tiny-promise
============

A Featherweight, damn fast, and "non-compliant" promise implementation. -- use at your own risk.

If you only need something that `then`s, and don't care about strict **Promises/A+** compatibility, this might be an option.

**Note**:

If you want to utilize the full advantage of **promises**, I would choose [one of the many options available, that play the game by the rules]()

If you want something designed to be tiny, and fast, with a side-effect of non-standard behavior, then feel free to hack around.

At any rate, this code walks like a promise, and talks like a promise, with occasional "quack"s in between.

Contributions are welcome.

Feel free to hack around.
